    <para id="element-63">Integrative Thinking and 21st Century Skills</para><para id="element-206">The process of integrative thinking is examined by Roger Martin in How Successful Leaders Think.  This thinking process is explained as the ability to use deductive reasoning to extract the best aspects from two opposing ideas, thus creating an alternative which possesses the strengths of both ideas (Martin, 2007).  Exemplary leaders in the business world have found success in this process of thinking.  Educational leaders can also achieve more successful decision making by using integrative thinking.</para><para id="element-573">An effective school administrator must possess the ability to use integrative thinking.  It is not necessary for the administrator to possess the ability to process opposing information and immediately produce a solution.  A competent administrator will use the process of integrative thinking by allowing time to consider the possible results of each idea.  Allowing time to process information and use sound judgment is the key to successful integrative thinking.  This is a skill that can be nurtured, but only if a person is willing to be open to various options, ideas, and is also open to failure.  Failure, an important aspect of integrative thinking, leads to success when administrators learn from the causes of the failure.  An integrative thinker will consider the strengths of various ideas and remember the result of former failures.  This entire thought process will result in a superior choice or solution.</para><para id="element-398">Leaders in the business world can choose not to use integrative thinking because it limits their power in decision making.  Education differs from the business world in this aspect because the underlying reason for being in a position of educational leadership should not be one of power.  Leadership should be about doing what is best for the education of children and the overall success of the school.  Unfortunately, some school administrators have a close-minded approach of, “it is my way or no way” which does not provide the best learning environment for our students.  Children learn by example.  If the example set forth in a school is the leadership style of integrative thinking and open-mindedness to ideas, students will be expected to exhibit some of these same qualities.</para><para id="element-523">The Partnership for Twenty-first Century Skills highlight the skills and thought processes children need in order for them to be competitive in today’s ever-changing society.  The expectation of teachers who incorporate these teaching strategies into their classrooms is to train students to use integrative thinking.  “Learning and innovation skills increasingly are being recognized as the skills that separate students who are prepared for increasingly complex life and work environments in the 21st century, and those who are not. A focus on creativity, critical thinking, communication and collaboration is essential to prepare students for the future.”  This statement, from the Partnership for 21st Century Skills, highlights the importance of instilling thinking skills into our youth.  Other components related to learning and innovation skills of the students include:  (1) Being open and responsive to new and diverse perspectives, (2) Making complex choices and decisions, and (3) Identifying and asking significant questions that clarify various points of view and lead to better solutions (www.21stcenturyskills.org). These three objectives are descriptors of the process of integrative thinking.</para><para id="element-128">The entire 21st Century Skills initiative is the product of educational leaders who have used integrative thinking.  Standards and assessments are mandated which produce an educational challenge.  These requirements are somewhat restrictive to educators; however, the integrative thinkers in this profession have found ways to overcome these obstacles. These individuals have created 21st Century Skills to enhance the education of our youth.  Research has shown that Americans do not rank as high as students from other countries in skills needed to succeed in the 21st century.  This is considered another obstacle to overcome.  The resolution has been the extensive development of standard based objectives specifically designed to address the needs of 21st century learners.  Using the guidelines set forth by the Partnership for 21st Skills to accomplish mandated standards is an excellent option to accomplish two important educational tasks.  By integrating the best aspects of two ideas into one, educators are given options above and beyond the scope of simple standards.</para><para id="element-973">At this time, only six states have officially adopted 21st Century Skills as their state-wide initiative.  This number will change as many more educational leaders use integrative thinking to search for new strategies in to which overcome educational challenges.  An effective leader continually evaluates and re-evaluates choices.  Because there will always be obstacles and challenges to overcome in the field of education, administrators must strive to become effective integrative thinkers to enhance the success of their school.  The integrative thinking process will allow educational leaders to make more complex decisions and judgments.</para><para id="element-161">The process of learning from mistakes, learning from others, taking advice when necessary, and considering all available options, will help lead to better choices and, in turn, make an effective leader.  Instilling the importance of thinking skills into our children is critical because they are the integrative thinkers of the future. </para>
