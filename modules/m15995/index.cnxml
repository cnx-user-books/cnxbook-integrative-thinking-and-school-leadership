    <para id="delete_me">Integrative thinking is a cognitive process which produces action. This action involves taking two ideas, pulling elements from both, and making a superior concept utilizing those elements. This is especially relevant in today’s classroom where instruction must be differentiated daily. Teachers must learn the concept of several theories and devise programs utilizing particular elements of each.  Numerous hours are spent creating lesson plans, constructing room designs, and modifying instruction so students will be able to learn. Various methodologies and theories play a prominent role in teachers’ designs. </para><para id="element-174">According to Roger Martin (2007) the four steps of decision making are the following: determining salience, analyzing causality, envisioning the decision architecture, and achieving reasoning.  Integrative thinking determines what factors are involved and how those factors are linked to outcomes. If a person does not conclude factors and the anticipated results, then an informative and integrative decision has not been made. The end result would be a convenient, simple decision based upon the ease of achieving the results. </para><para id="element-947">A true leader in any setting must think with the opposable mind. Effective leaders are the ones who do not look for a simple or convenient solution. Effective teachers are innovative and enthusiastic about learning. They may have many or few years of experience while teaching in any discipline. All four steps of the integrative thinking process work together to best determine the most beneficial initiative, along with its cause and effect. We as educators must teach our students how to use integrative thinking utilizing the four steps of decision making and incorporating into our lesson plans.  </para><para id="element-276">Martin, R.
